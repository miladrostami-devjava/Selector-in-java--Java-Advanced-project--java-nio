# implement a proxy server (Proxy Server) using Selector in Java

To implement a proxy server (Proxy Server) using Selector in Java,
you can use the non-blocking I/O (NIO) mechanism. Proxy servers
are usually placed between the client and the destination
server and receive the client's requests and forward them to the destination server.
Then they receive the response from the destination server and return it to the client.

In this example, we create a simple proxy server that receives incoming requests 
from clients and forwards them to
a destination server (which may be a web server or other service) 
and then returns a response to the client.

Scenario:
Client: The client connects to the proxy server and sends an HTTP 
request (or any other type of request).
Proxy server: The proxy server sends the client's request to the destination server
and waits for a response.
Destination server: The destination server sends the response to the proxy server.
Proxy: The proxy server returns the received response to the client.
